TOC dijit
===============
This is a customization of a Dojo Dijit for showing a generic table of map contents on a map created in the ESRI ArcGIS Javascript API.

This version is based on the source for the v2.10 version of the *Table of Contents (TOC)/Legend Widget for JavaScript API* by Nianwei Liu available [here](//www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9b6280a6bfb0430f8d1ebc969276b109).

### Differences in this version:

* Sublayers are hyperlinks to their REST service origin
* Groups of layers do not expand by default as in the original
* Groups only expand/contract lists of layers, they do not have check boxes to turn sublayers on/off
* Clicking the group or service layer line will also make it expand
* CSS styles modified to fit a tighter column
